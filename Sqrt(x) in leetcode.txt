Hint
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 

Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
 

Constraints:

0 <= x <= 231 - 1

answer.....

class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x)
    {
        int low = 0;
        int high = x;
        while (low<=high)
         {
            long long mid=(low+high)/2;
            if (mid*mid==x) 
            {
                return mid;
            }
             else if (mid*mid > x) 
            {
                high=mid-1;
            }
             else 
            {
                low=mid+1;
            }
        }
        return high;
    }
};
output:-
Input
x =
4
Output
2
Expected
2
